# MoonBridge Subgraph

An example Subgraph initially forked from The Graph [example subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph). Created by PureStake to monitor the Chainbridge bridges on Moonbeam.

## Setup

Install the node dependencies using `yarn`:

```shell
yarn
```

Create the TS types for The Graph (requires the `artifacts` folder):

```shell
yarn codegen
```

## Deploy the subgraph

Follow the TheGraph official documentation using the `graph-cli`.
